### Hello! I’m Victoria Drake. 👋

I’m a software developer at 💜 and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the 119540 words I’ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

This 🐷 says they 🤷 my latest blog post: **[Do I raise or return errors in Python?](https://victoria.dev/blog/do-i-raise-or-return-errors-in-python/)**. If you agree, you can subscribe to my [📡 **blog RSS**](https://victoria.dev/index.xml) or by email at [**victoria.dev**](https://victoria.dev).
